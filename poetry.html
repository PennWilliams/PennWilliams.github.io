	Birthday // 2014 June 17
				
		Dear Friend,
		
		A lot of time has passed,
		Since the induction of our friendship,
		A bond that will forever last,
		Through every bump and dip.
		
		It's hard to believe you're almost an adult,
		And finally your golden birthday,
		Time is always moving, never will it halt,
		Use it wisely, and always trust and obey.
		
		Out of all of the birthdays you've had,
		I hope this is the best one so far,
		Have some sake, women, and money to be glad,
		And know how appreciated you are.
		
		Happy birthday my friend!
		
		Always,
		Penn Williams

	Untitled // 2015 March
		
		Sinking sands and burning hands wasting the night away,
		Nobody cares but everyone stares as the sky turns gray,
		Fleeting pleasure, an earthly treasure, slowly begins to fade,
		Light and dark, shadow and spark, eats the life you've made,
		Darkened eyes and hopeless sighs search for what is right,
		Without a lead, a planted seed, they never find the light,
		Blind leading blind, never will they find, as they start to sink,
		Lost souls, crying from their holes, and we don't even blink.
					</h3>
